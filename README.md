 Toy compiler written in C from scratch.

## Building (Windows)
 The build is done by a single build script: run `build.bat` in a Developer Command Prompt.
 **NOTE**: The `build.sh` script is only used for double-checking (Clang has better warnings than MSVC), but the Linux builds are not actually tested.
